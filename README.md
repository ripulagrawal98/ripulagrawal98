#### Description
Computer Vision and Data Science enthusiast with experience in Python and most of its libraries that include OpenCV, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, sklearn, Keras, nltk, etc. I also have a keen interest in android development, natural language processing, deep learning apart from this I love to explore these technologies.<br>
I have worked on Android Development with Firebase database as backend, Gmail-addon development using Google App Script, and integrated it with Natural language processing written in Python script, to serve as backend and for deployment used Heroku. Also, build a chatbot using Dialogflow, the framework provides by Google and later integrated it with Telegram.<br>
